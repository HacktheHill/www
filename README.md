# Wicked Web Work

This is a sample To-do List web app for the Wicked Web Work workshop which is part of the [Hack the Hill](https://hackthehill.com) hackathon.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Feel free to edit these files to make the app your own or start from scratch.

The [challenges.md](challenges.md) file contains a list of challenges to try to complete. You can complete them in any order you like. The challenges are grouped by theme. You can complete as many or as few as you like. Each challenge is worth a certain number of points. The more points you earn, the higher your score will be. The highest score wins!

There is a junior for beginners and a senior track for more experienced developers. The challenges are the same for both tracks, but there is a separate leaderboard for each track so that developers of different skill levels can compete against each other.
